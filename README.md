YiiCms 企业站管理系统，基于 yii2 basic 开发
===============================

Yii 2 Basic Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
rapidly creating small projects.

页面前台样式基于bootStrap 3.0 开发，管理后台样式是 adminLTE，权限部分使用 yii2-admin,大部分都是拿来主义，不想重复造轮...
第三方包依赖管理使用 composer

2. 产品管理
3. 下载管理
4. 图片管理
5. 后台权限rbac
6. 前台菜单自定义、后台菜单自定义
7. 多模板多主题

      yiicms.sql          sql file
      composer.json       
    

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

~~~
1. git clone git@git.oschina.net:templi/yiicms.git

2. php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.2.0"
   php composer.phar install

3. import yiicms.sql

4. Database config

5. 配置 ngixn 虚拟机或者apache虚拟机 网站根目录指向 yiicms/web/
   或者 修改/config/web.php url路由配置

~~~

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yiicms',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '123456',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```


config/web.php 中作如下修改 或者 将网站根目录直接指向 yiicms/web/ 目录

```

'enablePrettyUrl' => false,

```


**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `yiicms` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
1. 网站跟目录指向 yiicms/web/

http://domain.com/ 前台
http://domain.com/backend/ 后台

2. 修改url路由规则
http://localhost/yiicms/web/  前台
http://localhost/yiicms/web/index.php?r=backend 后台

~~~



TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
composer exec codecept run
``` 

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser. 


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ``` 

5. (Optional) Create `yii2_basic_tests` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/test_db.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   composer exec codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   composer exec codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   composer exec codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
composer exec codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
composer exec codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
composer exec codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
